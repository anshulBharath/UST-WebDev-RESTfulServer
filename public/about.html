                <p>Hello there! I am a senior at the University of St. Thomas. I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Philosophy. When I am not doing school, I
                work part time as a software developer for Pearson VUE. In my free time, I enjoy reading books, especially science fiction. I am currently
                reading "The Mote in God's Eye" which is one of the most interesting sci-fi novels I have ever read. I also enjoy playing guitar
                and piano and spending time with my big family!</p>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This website was created using the Leaflet API, Nominatim API, and a custom API we created for St. Paul crime data all on the Vue Framework. <br>
                    
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaflet is the API that we used to utilize different map functions. With this API we were able to create markers on the map and get specific 
                    latitudes and longitdudes of specific areas. Leaflet has a lot of functionality and customization, but a large learning curve. <br>
        
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nominatim is an API used to get locations and addresses. This was mainly used in our search bar, so that we could convert street addresses
                    into latitudes and longitudes as per the specifications of Leaflet. <br>
                    
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our custome API is a REST API that is attached to a crime database. You can provide different options in order to query different crimes. This 
                    API was used for populating our table and filtering our results to the table.<br>
        
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vue.js was the client-side framework that we used to build our front-end and handle data that was going from our client to our app. Vue
                    made our lives a whole lot easier when creating this site and gave us an introduction into how powerful client-side frameworks are.

        <ul class="about_list">
            <li>There have been <b>41</b> murders in St. Paul over a span of 7 years</li>
            <li>Surprisingly large number of Proactive Police Visits</li>
            <li>Never knew exactly how St. Pauls major neighborhoods were laid out, so it is interesting to see them visually</li>
            <li>The amount of incidents a day is higher than I expected</li>
            <li>Suprisingly large number of Arsons</li>
            <li>St. Thomas Campus is perfectly split by Union Park Neighborhood and Macalester-Groveland neighborhood</li>
